### Abstract
What does it mean to measure in the (digital) humanities? Using literary studies as a point of departure, this keynote addresses the conceptual and practical challenges of measurement in the humanities, interrogating two common assumptions: that measurement must necessarily involve quantification, and that such processes are inherently incapable of capturing the richness and complexity of literary texts. While these assumptions reflect valid concerns, they often stem from a limited understanding of what measurement actually entails. Drawing on the example of temperature measurement as a conceptual framework, I will examine the challenges that measurement practices face within the digital humanities. Rather than rejecting measurement as reductive or accepting it uncritically, this talk advocates for a more reflective and responsible engagement—one that also acknowledges the humanist’s role in shaping the procedures by which we measure our objects of study.
