## Oral Presentations

Oral presentations are strictly **15 minutes** long, directly followed by **5 minutes** for Q&A.  
Please respect these time limits to ensure fairness and smooth scheduling. Session chairs will strictly enforce timing.

To ensure compatibility, presentations must be in **PDF format only** and uploaded to the shared folder (link will be provided a few days before the conference) **by 23:59 CEST on the day before your session**.


## Poster Presentations

Poster presentations will be preceded by a **Poster Madness** session, where each presenter has exactly **2 minutes** to pitch their poster.

To ensure a smooth and fair session, presenters are asked to:
- Queue up at the side of the stage in advance
- Stick to the 2-minute time limit (no Q&A during this session)
- Leave the stage promptly when signaled by the chairs

Each presenter must prepare a **1-slide PDF** (landscape, ideally 16:10 ratio) that includes at least the poster title and author names, to be uploaded to the shared folder (link will be provided a few days before the conference) **by 23:59 CEST on June 9, 2025**.

**Poster Display**. Each presenter will be provided with:
- a poster wall for displaying a **printed A0 poster in portrait format (841mm x 1189mm)**
- basic materials (tape, pins, etc.) for mounting

Please note: **on-site poster printing is not available**. Presenters must bring their printed posters to the venue.
