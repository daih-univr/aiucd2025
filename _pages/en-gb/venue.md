The conference is organized by the [Digital Arena for Inclusive Humanities (DAIH)](https://www.daih.eu) at the [University of Verona](https://www.univr.it).

All the scientific activities and meetings will take place at [Polo Santa Marta](https://www.univr.it/it/santa-marta) ([Via Cantarane, 24](https://www.openstreetmap.org/directions?from=&to=45.438518%2C11.011468)) of the University of Verona.

## Santa Marta University Campus
The Santa Marta University Campus is located in a large military architectural complex, originally intended for the storage of cereals and supplies for the troops.
The facility was one of the most important logistical sites of the Austrian fortress system in Verona.
Thanks to recent restorations promoted by the University of Verona, the Santa Marta complex has become the site of the departments in the economic and legal fields.

The main building, known as the *Provianda*, has reached us with very few alterations from its original structure. The building still consists of a five-story main body, one of which is underground. Inside, there is now a permanent exhibition that retraces its history, placing the building within the urban context it belongs to, and exploring the theme that connects soldiers and food. 


## Conference Spaces

The conference sessions will be held in the *Silos di Ponente* building, in the following lecture rooms:  *Aula Magna*, *Aula SPA*, *Aula SPB*. Coffee breaks, lunches, and poster session will take place in the main building, *Provianda*.
