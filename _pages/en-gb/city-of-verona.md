Verona, nestled in the heart of the Veneto Region, sets itself as a stage of history and culture, where the memory of the past echoes through the streets and squares. Among its architectural jewels, Ponte Pietra stands out, the oldest bridge in the city, built by the Romans in the first century BC, a witness to the great engineering of the time. Crossing the Adige with its elegant arch structure, it connects the city centre with San Pietro's Hill.

This city, a UNESCO heritage site, offers a journey through the centuries, from the majesty of the Roman Arena, which still hosts events of international resonance, to the romantic charm of the House of Juliet,  symbol of a love story that has conquered the world. The beating heart of Verona is revealed in its squares, such as Piazza delle Erbe, a lively crossroads of history and commerce, and Piazza dei Signori, surrounded by elegant palaces that narrate the power of the ancient lordships. Castelvecchio, with its Scaliger bridge, offers evocative views of the Adige, the river that gently embraces the city.

Verona, however, is not only history: it is also a sensory experience, through the intense flavour of Valpolicella wines and traditional dishes. The city invites you to take a leisurely stroll, discovering hidden corners and a unique atmosphere.
