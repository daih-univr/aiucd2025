Authors interested in submitting a proposal for AIUCD 2025 are invited to carefully read all the instructions on this page.

## Template for Preparing the Proposal

Proposals must be submitted **exclusively** in PDF format and prepared using the **NEW** template, available here:

* [AIUCD 2025 Proposal Template](/assets/template/template-AIUCD2025.zip)

The template has been updated from previous years to improve citation management, now following the APA style, and to optimize the document's accessibility, ensuring wider access to the content.

The downloadable package includes the following files:

- ```Template-AIUCD-2025-ENG.docx``` and ```Template-AIUCD-2025-ITA.docx```: editable files in MS Word/DOCX format. We recommend starting from these files based on the language of the proposal if you are using Microsoft Word.
- ```Template-AIUCD-2025-ENG-ODT.odt``` and ```Template-AIUCD-2025-ITA-ODT.odt```: editable files in OpenDocument Text format, compatible with software such as OpenOffice or LibreOffice. Use these files according to the language of the proposal if you are using one of these programs.
- ```Template-AIUCD-2025-ENG.pdf``` and ```Template-AIUCD-2025-ITA.pdf```: reference PDFs that show the expected final appearance of the submission.

It is the authors' responsibility to ensure that the proposal is formatted according to the provided template. Proposals that do not follow the template will be rejected without review. The organizers will not perform any post-editing to adapt submissions to the conference template.

When saving or exporting the document to PDF, please ensure that you enable the options to generate an accessible PDF in your word processing software (e.g., [Microsoft Word](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-accessible-pdfs-064625e0-56ea-4e16-ad71-3aa33bb4b7ed), [LibreOffice](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Accessibility/Creating_Accessible_LibreOffice_Files)).
